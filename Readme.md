You'll find a small amount of info about the Neo Geo CD front loader model here.

I added a capacitor map for all 3 boards. The main and I/O board both use Toshin Kogyo capacitors. There doesn't seem to be any series markers on them, just the TK logo, the capacitance, voltage, temp, and a date code perhaps. Either way, there are only 2 kinds used, one black, and one blue.

The CD drive board uses all Nichicon VX series caps. 

There are no minis, no bipolars, or anything else out of the ordinary.

I will add a DigiKey list at some point in the future.
